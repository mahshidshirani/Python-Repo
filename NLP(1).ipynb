              " '\\n\\n\\r\\n                Process Manufacturing\\r\\n            \\nAny industry that produces bulk quantities of goods, including pharmaceuticals, food, chemicals, or cosmetics is seeking to improve product quality and get their products to market quicker. Simulation is increasingly used by engineers and scientists during research, development, and through to process improvement to achieve these goals. The use of computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools reduces development time and dependence on costly physical prototyping and testing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncrease Process Efficiency \\nThe use of computer simulation in the process manufacturing industries can help improve understanding of processes and provide key insight into operations otherwise difficult or sometimes impossible to obtain. This can result in increased process efficiency and help drive product and process innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprove Product Quality\\nNumerical simulation provides the means to control product consistency and quality. It can help companies develop new process strategies and evaluate the effects of process design and scale up on product characteristics. It is a powerful predictive tool that can support the adoption of continuous manufacturing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMixing\\nAltair EDEMâ„¢ can simulate the mixing process of powders, tablets, aggregates, and other granular materials. It provides fundamental information such as the particle velocities and trajectories and allows for the prediction of mixing and segregation rates as well as the identification of dead zones. This enables operators to make informed decisions on the optimal process operational parameters for their equipment regarding the impact of speed, fill level, tilt angle, etc., and to assess mixing efficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTablet Coating\\nCoating uniformity is of critical importance for the tablet-coating process. With EDEM it is possible to obtain key parameters such as the residence time of the tablets under the coating spray, intra-tablet coating variability, and tablets velocities pattern â€“ many of these are difficult or even impossible to get by experimentation. EDEM can also be used to investigate how the shape of a tablet, the drumâ€™s speed, and the fill level are influencing the coating process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDie Filling\\nDie filling is a common step in many industries including pharmaceuticals and powder metallurgy. A consistent and uniform process is very important as it influences the quality of the final product or component. EDEM can be used to assess the effect of various key parameters, understand micro-macro dynamics of particles inside the feed frame, and visualize segregation inside the feed frame and during die filling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPowder Spreading and Raking\\nThe powder spreading process in additive manufacturing (AM) has a major impact on the characteristics and quality of the final product. EDEM can be used to simulate that process and investigate the impact of different operational parameters such as roller speed on the quality of the powder bed as well as evaluating powder spreading uniformity. EDEM can be applied to various aspects of the AM process including powder delivery, spreading, and cleaning operations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFluidized Beds\\nFluidized beds are commonplace in industry â€“ particularly in chemical processing â€“ and are used in a wide variety of processes such as freezing, cooling, heating, and coating. By coupling computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with discrete element modeling (DEM) using Altair AcuSolveâ„¢ with EDEM companies can accurately simulate fluidized beds and other particle-fluid systems. DEM-CFD provides key information and can be used to assess the quality of fluidization and to understand mixing and segregation phenomena.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConveying Equipment\\nScrew conveyors are frequently used in a range of industries to transport granular materials. With EDEM, companies can analyze the flow rate of different materials in the conveyor and get information on the forces and wear on equipment. EDEM can be used to predict any risk of blockages, assess the mixing and compression of the material, and obtain information on system capacity and power requirements.\\n\\n',\n",

It needs to develop robust and aerodynamic rail car designs that provide comfort and safety to the passengers. To succeed companies must exploit CAE as early as possible in the process to drive decision making and deliver designs on time, on target, and on cost.\\nDigitalization has also emerged as a key driver for innovation in railways. It provides significant opportunities to streamline operations, improve reliability of assets, and enhance passenger (or freight customer) experience while reducing costs. It is being used to derive real-time information on rail movements and is an enabler of predictive maintenance for fixed assets and rolling stock. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaximize Reliability, Availability, and Desirability\\nOptimized and Robust Designs: Altair OptiStructâ„¢ and Altair HyperStudyâ„¢ are powerful tools in the design development to meet performance requirements, all while handling the trade-offs in an automated manner.

Altair MotionSolveâ„¢ is a powerful product for full dynamic simulation, including those with flexible bodies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOptimize Connectivity and Operational Costs\\nNetwork Connectivity: Equipment connectivity and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is essential to todayâ€™s rolling stock, and can be optimized with Altair Fekoâ„¢ and Altair Fluxâ„¢. FekoÂ® is widely for the design and placement of antennas and modeling wave propagation for network simulation. Flux can evaluate the magnetic field radiated by power cables and busbars, and the effect of external fields on the operation of sensors or actuators. Feko can also simulate both the radiation and irradiation of cables, antennas, and devices to inform the design of effective shielding.\\nElectric Drivetrains: Altair FluxMotorâ„¢ is dedicated to the simulation-driven design of electric rotating machines. It enables users to build from standard or customized parts, add windings and change materials to quickly develop a concept design. Flux models even the most complex electromechanical systems with proven accuracy. It provides multiphysics capabilities â€“ magneto static, steady-state and transient conditions, along with electrical and thermal properties â€“ to optimize machine performance, efficiency, dimensions, cost, and weight.\\nReduce Downtime and Extend Useful Life: Asset management with the Internet of Things (IoT) has given birth to \"digital twins\" of critical assets. Digital twins help organizations optimize product performance, gain visibility into the in-service life of a product, know when and where to perform predictive maintenance, and how to extend a productâ€™s remaining useful life (RUL).\\n\\n',\n",
